	My friend had a hamster.
	<p>
		Now, it is known that hamsters do not live very long, and this hamster is dead since decades.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was a nice little pet, but it was an omnivore – he ate everything that came near his paws and
		mouth.
	</p>
	<p>
		And so it happened one day when I was visiting my friend and we just entered his room, where the
		hamster was, that we saw the last bit of a note disappearing in the hamster’s mouth.
	</p>
	<p>That hard earned money was gone forever – eaten by a hungry hamster.</p>
	<p>
		Money sometimes seems to disappear miracolously and we wonder whether some kind of hamster is
		hungrily running around in our house.

	<p>To help you finding out whether it was the cash hamster, we made up this app.</p>
	<p>May it help you to detect the loss!</p>
